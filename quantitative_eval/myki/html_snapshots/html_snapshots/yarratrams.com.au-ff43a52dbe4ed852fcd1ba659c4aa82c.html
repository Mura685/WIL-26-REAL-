<h3><div class="expanding-toggle">Travelling with a Mobility Aid or a Pram</div></h3>
<div class="expanding-view"><p>Currently, not all trams or stops are easy to access for people using mobility aids or prams. However, you can safely use our services by boarding and getting off low-floor trams at level access stops.</p>
<p>Here is how you can plan for and safely travel by tram when using a mobility aid or pram.</p>
<h3>Planning your trip when travelling with a mobility aid or pram</h3>
<p>Plan your trip to make sure that both your starting and ending tram stops are level access, and that your tram is a low-floor tram. Use these tools and resources to help with your journey planning:</p>

<h3>Travelling by tram with a mobility aid or pram</h3>
<h4>Boarding the tram</h4>
<p>When boarding the tram, use the accessible doors marked with an Accessibility symbol (this is known as the "blue wheelchair symbol"). These doors lead to a space inside the tram reserved for mobility aid users and can also be used by people with prams. This area is marked with the Accessibility symbol on the floor.</p>
<h4>Alighting the tram</h4>
<p>Let the driver know you want to get off the tram at the next stop by using the Stop Request Button marked with the blue Accessibility symbol. These are located in the space reserved for mobility devices. This button will let the driver know you want to get off at the next stop, and you may need the doors to stay open longer. When you do alight the tram, use the doors that are marked with the Accessibility symbol.</p></div>

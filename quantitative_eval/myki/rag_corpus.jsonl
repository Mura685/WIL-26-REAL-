Our teams are working hard every day to minimise delays caused by trespassing, emergency services requests, equipment faults, ill passengers, vandalism, external power outages, infrastructure upgrade works, vehicles on level crossings and extreme weather. We are committed to continuously improving the performance of the network, and the experience for our passengers.", "doc_type": "general"}

We thank our passengers for their patience while we complete critical upgrade works that will deliver lasting benefits for all Q.Why does Metro need to maintain and renew the network? - Planned maintenance works are safety critical upgrades that keep the railway running safely and reliably for our passengers. - Major project works, such as removing level crossings and building new stations, sometimes require buses to replace trains on section so network for days, weeks or even months.

Q.What impacts should local residents or traders expect during planned works? - maintenance works in and around the rail corridor near your property - heavy machinery in the works area, including special track machines, excavators, front end loaders and chainsaws - medium to high level construction noise during the set up and use of the heavy machinery - Safety is our top priority in everything we do.

Q. Why does faulty equipment cause trains to be delayed or suspended? - If trains, tracks, signalling or electrical systems are damaged, Metro may be required to slow or even suspend train services for a period of time.This process ensures the safety of our passengers and employees. - If a fault occurs, our systems are designed to prevent further safety issues from occurring.", "doc_type": "faq"}

Illegal behavior can be dangerous and delays our passengers. Q. Why are services delayed by trespassing? - Trespassing on the railway is incredibly dangerous and can stop trains in their tracks – causing significant and unnecessary disruption to our passengers. - New anti-trespasser ground panels are being trialled at five railway stations across the network to improve safety and curb the number of incidents that delay passengers.

We are always striving to deliver the best possible service for the people who rely on our trains every day. Q. How can delays in one part of Melbourne affect trains on another part of the network? - Melbourne’s rail network covers more than 1000 kilometres. - Currently all lines connect at Flinders Street Station. - When a disruption occurs, passengers may notice changes to their services departing from Flinders Street, with the potential for knock-on delays to multiple lines. - Some lines run directly through Flinders Street to link with other lines on the other side of the city (such as Werribee and Frankston). - In these cases, an issue on one line can impact another. - Alterations are only used to avoid knock-on delays to more people – because a delayed train can impact passengers on every train behind it.", "doc_type": "faq"}

The burn line – a visual train departure countdown – is reducing last-second boarders forcing train doors and shaving crucial seconds off departures. - Like planes at an airport, trains are allotted a platform and specific arrival and departure times.
